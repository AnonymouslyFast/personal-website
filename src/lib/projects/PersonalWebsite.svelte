<h4>About this project</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    This is a website created by only me, this website is for the purpose of just showing off my skills as a developer.
    I also wanted to learn some website development with Svelte and typescript, as of now I know the basics of both.
    Please enjoy the site, and this code is on my github as a repository, and is hosted by github pages.
