<h4>About this project</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    This is a website created by only me, this website is for the purpose of just showing off my skills as a developer.
    I also wanted to learn some website development with Svelte and typescript, as of now I know the basics of both. I
    also used this site as a something easy to test out hosting on my physical server. So as of August 29th, 2025 this
    website has been fully hosted by me.
