<h4>Introduction</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    EcoZero is a game developed and designed by me and CryptixSFX. This video game is currently in production
    and has no release date as it's a lot of work with just 1 developer and 1 designer. We have made progress on it, and
    have the barebones of a survival mechanic as of right now.

<h4>About the project</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    EcoZero is currently is in production, but we have some idea of the ending product. We want EcoZero to be a 3D
    story based game, as of such it's a very story enriched game, with survival and horror aspects as well. EcoZero is
    inspired on projects like The Forest and The SCP Foundation.
