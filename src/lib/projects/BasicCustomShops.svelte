<h4>Introduction</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    BasicCustomShops (BCS) is a project I've made specifically to try and get better at Java, and has greatly increased
    my knowledge in the subject. This project took me around 2 weeks to complete, and it was a great learning experience
    for me; I learnt a lot about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and just basic computer science theory.

<h4>About the project</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    BasicCustomShops is a Minecraft java plugin for servers with the version 1.21.*. This plugin is a economy shops
    plugin, which lets you create, delete, and modify custom shops for your server. It lets players buy and sell products
    sold by the shop. This plugin is not for production servers, and likely has a lot of bugs, please don't try this plugin
    outside a development server.
